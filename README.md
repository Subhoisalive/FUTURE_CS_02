🔐 **Cyber Security Internship – Task 2: Introduction to Web Application Security**

## 📄 Overview

This repository contains all documentation and resources related to Task 2 of my Cyber Security Internship at **FutureTrix**. The task focuses on web application security and includes vulnerability scanning, analysis, and hands-on exploitation of common vulnerabilities using OWASP ZAP and TryHackMe labs.


## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand key concepts in web application security.
- Identify and exploit common vulnerabilities such as:
  - SQL Injection
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Perform vulnerability analysis using **OWASP ZAP**.
- Gain practical exposure using platforms like **TryHackMe**.


## 🛠️ Tools Used

- 🌐 [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/)
- 🧠 [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)
- 💻 Simple web applications (test targets)


## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. Setup and configured OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning.
2. Scanned a sample web application for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
3. Focused on finding:
   - **SQL Injection**
   - **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**
   - **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**
4. Learned how each vulnerability works from ZAP’s detailed descriptions.
5. Manually exploited SQL Injection using lab environments on TryHackMe.
6. Documented findings and captured screenshots as evidence.


## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

- Difficulty setting up OWASP ZAP → Resolved by following YouTube tutorials.
- Understanding SQL Injection exploitation → Practiced hands-on with TryHackMe labs.


## 📸 Screenshots & Artifacts

- OWASP ZAP Scan Reports
- SQL Injection Exploitation from TryHackMe
- Vulnerability Descriptions and Proof of Concepts (PoCs)

(See `Screenshots/` and `Artifacts/` folders for evidence.)


## 📚 Key Web Security Concepts

| Concept              | Description                                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Authentication       | Verifying user identity (e.g., MFA, login credentials)       |
| Authorization        | Granting access based on roles and permissions               |
| SQL Injection        | Inserting SQL commands to bypass login or extract data       |
| XSS                  | Injecting malicious scripts into web pages                   |
| CSRF                 | Forging unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user   |
| Input Validation     | Sanitizing input to prevent attacks                          |
| Session Management   | Protecting session tokens and timeout mechanisms             |
| Patch Management     | Updating apps to fix known vulnerabilities                   |
